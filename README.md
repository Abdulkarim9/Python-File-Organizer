## Python basic file manager script
## For windows

This basic python script moves any PDF, WORD, EXCEL, TEXT files and IMAGES from Downloads directory to their own folder which will be created by this script. I coded this script to do this work for me if want to organize your files feel free to use it and also feel free to improve it if you wish.

For the (.pyw) extention i put it  in order to prevent a DOS console from popping up.

### How to use?
For this program to work you need to have python3 installed on you system

if you don't you can download from this link https://www.python.org/downloads/

after downloading the script you can directly run it in the command line by typing the following command
```bash
python file_organizer.pyw
```

### If you want to make it run automaticly on windows startup (script will start anytime your computer starts).
### Follow these instructions
```bash
1- Go to the folder where you put the script file


2- Create a shortcut of the file. # in order to create a shortcut right click you will see (create shortcut in the bottom) click on it and shortcut will be created.


3- Cut the shortcut you created and press [windows+r] on your keyboard, a prompt will pop up in the bottom left side enter "shell:startup" and press Enter.


4- You will be brought to startup directory now paste that shortcut and that's it.
```

This script will run every 30 seconds but you can change the time if you would like to.


### Note that you need to restart your computer for the script to run.
